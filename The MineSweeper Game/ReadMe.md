This game is totally the same playing style in a windowed game unless it is played in a console. You enter the row and the column size of your minesweeper map.
The game shows you the places of the bombs by 1 in a map. Then you pick up a tile and if it is not a bomb, it shows you how many bombs are around your picked tile.
If there are no bombs all around your tile, these tiles are then marked by 0. The game asked you to mark the places of the bombs. It is up to you to decide. 
When you have marked all the bombs places correctly, you win the game. You can replay the game when you loose as well as you win.
Have fun...
